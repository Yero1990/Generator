# process Im currently running on fermilab machines (in background) to 
calculate (generate xml files) with cross sections (takes ~ 24 hrs)

See: https://genie-docdb.pp.rl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=2
for details of the commands below
                                       
>> gmkspl -p 11 -t 1000060120 -e 10 -o carbon12_spline_EMPlusMEC_G18_10a_02_11a.xml --tune G18_10a_02_11a --event-generator-list EM

# after above process finishes, run the command below to generate 10 events from genie (as a test), 
and them move on to generating more events (e.g. 10k, etc)

>> gevgen -n 10 -p 11 -t 1000060120 -e 0.56  --event-generator-list EM --tune G18_10a_02_11a --cross-sections carbon12_spline_EMPlusMEC_G18_10a_02_11a.xml 

# need to ask Afro what this command was again (is it to convert ghep to root format?)
>> gntpc -f gst -i gntp.0.ghep.root
